1. Deploy a contract to account 0x03 called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable named is, and make it have type String. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.

2.Check that your variable is actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.
